This is a simple project, used to speed up local kubernetes deployment.
This project requires a Virtual Box and Vagrant to function.
Run the setUpScript.sh to provision the virtual machines, and start Rancher.
After the setUpScript is finished, access the host IP from the browser and follow the instructions from there.
